Simple console application, allowing user to create a grocery list.

How it works?
    • The app shows the user menu.
    • A user can: display instructions, print the list of saved grocery items, add an item to the list, modify an item in the list,
    remove an item from the list, search for an item in the list.

The app consists of two classes:
    • GroceryList class, that implements all methods, like: addGroceryItem, modifyGroceryItem, removeGroceryItem, or findGroceryItem.
    • Main class, that implements the user menu.

Used tools/frameworks:
    • Java (e.g. Scanner(System.in)),
    • IDE: IntelliJ
